# Enrollment-Automation
A program that receives enrollment forms of providers to be enrolled in a provider network. The image/file is then converted into text, and an LLM will be used to find the information we need to enroll them.
Once all the information is found, it will be organized and stored on a Google Sheet. Then an automated web-bot will handle the enrollment process into the company database of providers.
